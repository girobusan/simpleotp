Simple OTP encoder/decoder
==========================

Made for educational purpose. Simple One-Time Pad encoder and decoder.

It cam encrypt or decrypt digitaly coded message using one time pad. You have to code your message before encryption (or after decryption)  youself (using good old staggererd chekerboard, for example). I've wrote it as an exercise.
