It cam encrypt or decrypt digitaly coded message using one time pad. You have to code your message before encryption (or after decryption) yourself (using good old staggererd chekerboard, for example). 

How it works
-----------

1. Enter your one-time key at corresponding tab
1. Enter your text in "Encrypt/decrypt" tab
1. Change encryption/decryption algorythm in Edit menu, if desired
1. Click "Encrypt" to encrypt source text with entered key, or "Decrypt" to decrypt

Encryption algorythms
---------------------

There are two possibilitues: **encrypt message using modular addition,** and then decrypt using modular substraction, or **encrypt using substraction,** and decrypt using additions. The first one is default for this program (checked in Edit menu).
